            <h1>The Reaping</h1>
            <p id="p1">
                &emsp; Each district's escort randomly chooses the name of one male and one female tribute from two separate glass balls. <br>
                Those picked are then the official tributes for the upcoming Games. 
                To be qualified for a reaping, one must be at least 12 years old. <br>
                &emsp; Once of age, a potential-tribute's name is entered into the reaping one time. The entries are cumulative,
                so when a possible tribute is thirteen, their name is added one more time. This continues until age 18, 
                when a potential-tribute's name is entered 7 times, or more if they apply for tesserae.

        <article id="chariot_rides">
            <h1>Chariot Rides</h1>
            <p id="p2">
                &emsp; Before entering the Training Center for the first time, tributes for the Hunger Games 
                are required to ride chariots in a procession through the Capitol. This event, known as 
                the "Tribute Parade", is very important because it is a chance for the tributes to make an 
                impression on the citizens of the Capitol, thus attracting potential sponsors. <br>
                &emsp; The drawing-in of sponsors is crucial to the tributes' survival in the arena. This is also the first time the Capitol 
                audience sees the tributes in person, and it gives them an idea of what to expect from each district's competitors.

        <article id="training_center">
            <h1>Training Center</h1>
            <p id="p3">
                &emsp; The Training Center is a building located in the middle of the Capitol, 
                just behind the President's Mansion on the City Circle. 
                Upon arriving to the city in preparation for the Hunger Games, it is where tributes live and train. <br>
                &emsp; The center has an open roof, which includes a garden and provides an excellent view of the Capitol. 
                It is also enclosed by a force field to thwart any attempt at suicide. The tributes and their entourages 
                each stay on a floor corresponding with number of their district, which are reached via glass-sided elevators 
                that move at rapid speeds.

        <article id="interviews">
            <h1>Interviews</h1>
            <p id="p4">
                &emsp; The night before the start of each Hunger Games, Caesar Flickerman hosts an interview with each of the tributes. 
                The tributes dress up so as to cause an impression on the Capitol. 
                Caesar dresses with a suit, hair, lips, and eye color all the same color. 
                He wears a different color wig every Hunger Games. <br>
                &emsp; Caesar asks them about their life back home, their time in the Capitol so far, their training score, and the reaping. 
                He is noted to try to help all the tributes through their interview. The interviews are in order of districts with the 
                female preceding the male tribute. Each interview is allotted three minutes per tribute.

        <article id="arena">
            <h1>Arenas</h1>
            <p id="p5">
                &emsp; An arena is a large, enclosed, outdoor area where the Hunger Games were held each year. 
                Arenas are designed by the Gamemakers and a new one is built every year. 
                It could be anything from dense forest to an open meadow, a frozen wasteland to a scorched desert, etc. <br>
                &emsp; The Gamemakers plant traps and cunning ideas into the arena, to entertain the people of Panem. 
                All arenas have a Cornucopia, which contains weapons, food, etc. It is also where the tributes launch into the arena 
                to begin the Games. Also, all the arenas have force fields around them that will bounce back anything that hits it. 
                Over the years a few tributes have used it as a weapon. <br>
                &emsp; Before the invention of the Arenas, tributes fought to the death at the Capitol Arena, 
                a dilapidated amphitheater that had been used for sports and events prior to the Dark Days.

        <article id="victory_tour">
            <h1>Victory Tour</h1>
            <p id="p6">
                &emsp; Following each Hunger Games, the Capitol runs a Victory Tour featuring the victor(s) of the previous Games 
                travelling around Panem. It begins in District 12 and then goes in descending order to District 1, followed by the Capitol. 
                The winner's district is skipped and saved for last. <br>
                &emsp; Designed to lower the districts' self-esteem and show off the power the Capitol has over them, 
                the Tour is placed almost halfway between the annual Games in order to keep the horror fresh and immediate. <br>
                &emsp; The victor(s) would give a speech in each district, often a speech already prepared by their escort and mentor(s). 
                The speech often thanks the Capitol for their "generosity" and offers their condolences to the fallen tributes' family members. Finally, there's a large dinner held in the victor's home district.
